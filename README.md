# BlazorApp
This app is just me having my first play around with Microsoft Blazor Web assembly implementation.

We are quite competitive at the office I work at, so I "borrowed" the official Crash Bandicoot leaderboards page and modified it to display the times we had recorded in our office.

I modified the template application with my styles, and made some custom components that are re-used (the drop down boxes). I also use a shared state across the pages by injecting a singleton class that keeps track of the current drop down values so they can be filtered correctly.

Check out [https://blazor.net/](https://blazor.net/) for information on how to get started with Blazor.
